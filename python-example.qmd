# Python Example

This is an example of a Python-based Quarto document.

The first thing we do is to read our file from project storage.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
penguins = pd.read_csv("penguins.csv")
```

## Head of penguins data

Here are the first few rows of the data.

```{python}
penguins.head()
```

## Describing the Data

In @fig-desc, you can see the descriptive statistics for the penguins data.

```{python}
#| label: fig-desc
#| fig-cap: Descriptive statistics for penguins data.
penguins.describe()
```
